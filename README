Fiqne PHP MVC Framework

This is a PHP MVC framework I developed to try and reduce the complexities (time and processing) of the Zend framework's dispatch process. It's very similar to Zend but really isn't meant for use in production (yet). I never got round to finishing it but if you want to dig into some PHP code, go right ahead, the code is well documented and readable.
